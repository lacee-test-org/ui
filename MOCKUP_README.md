#### Workspace
The workspace will show all the workspace the user has to manage or join.
For each workspace, there are four roles: `Admin`, `Designer`, `Developer`, `Approver`.
- If the user click **Create Workspace**, this user will become an `Admin` of this workspace by default. 
- If the user click **Join Workspace**, this user needs to type the workspace name and invitation code. The role is already assigned by the workspace's admin. This user will be either `Designer`, `Developer` or `Approver`.
